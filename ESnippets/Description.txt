This directed study will produce a software tool that reads in YACC/Bison .y
files, constructs a data structure representing the context free grammar,
and uses it to generate a set of example syntax error fragments in Merr
format that exercise the entire grammar.

The tool will be applied to the Unicon grammar, and to test generality,
also the RTL language grammar from the Unicon implementation. For the
Unicon grammar, the student will construct error diagnostic messages for
each fragment in consultation with the instructor.

The directed study will be completed with an electronic submission of the
stub generator and generated fragment files, and a written report that
describes the tool and its use.
